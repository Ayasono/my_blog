> Glad to see you here, I am AyaSono. It's my nickname on internet. If you are from the company side, I believe you know my real name from my resume.

### Background

After completing my business degree from the University of Alberta in Canada, I am currently on track to graduate from the University of Liverpool with a master's degree in management. Utilizing my time during the Covid pandemic, I took it upon myself to learn coding and have successfully transitioned into a role as a front-end engineer. 

I enjoy learning new skills and am currently looking for a full-time position in the front-end development field.

### Skills

Vue, React, Svelte, Node.js, MySQL, Python, HTML, CSS, SASS, Tailwind, JavaScript, TypeScript, Git, Linux, etc.

My goal is to become a full stack engineer, and I am currently learning backend skills.

### Internship

I worked as a front-end engineer for 6 months. I am responsible for the front-end development of the company's official website and the development of the company's internal management system.

**Highlights**

- Used Vue-directives to implement authorization management
- Used virtual scroll to optimize the performance of the page
- Implemented large file upload and resumable file transfer
